# 26001 – Mental Health Support Apps

## Problem Statement

Chatbots and digital therapy tools to bridge the mental health support gap.

India is witnessing a rapid rise in stress, anxiety, depression, and other mental health concerns. However, access to timely and affordable mental health support remains limited due to stigma, shortage of trained professionals, and unequal distribution of services.

This project aims to design an innovative, scalable, and accessible digital support system that enables:

- Early emotional distress detection  
- Anonymous and privacy-sensitive interaction  
- Multilingual accessibility  
- AI-assisted first-level mental health support  
- Structured escalation during high-risk situations
